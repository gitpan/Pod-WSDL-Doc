DESCRIPTION
    This module is used internally by Pod::WSDL. It is unlikely that you
    have to interact directly with it. If that is the case, take a look at
    the code, it is rather simple.

METHODS
  new
    Instantiates a new Pod::WSDL::Attr. The method needs one parameter, the
    documentation string from the pod. Please see SYNOPSIS or the section
    "Pod Syntax" in the description of Pod::WSDL.
